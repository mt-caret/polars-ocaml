  # In the past we tried to support building this on 32bit architectures,[1] but
  # some of polars' crates clearly don't support it[2] and getting both the
  # OCaml and Rust compilers to work on 32bit is a pain, so we are leaving
  # this comment as a reminder so that we do not try this without sufficient
  # motivation again.
