(* This file is not technically syntactically correct OCaml, since it's meant
  to be evaluated by the toplevel so also contains toplevel directives.
  This seems to confuse ocamlformat which then formats this file in way that
  breaks MDX. To avoid this, we use a ".txt" extension instead of the usual ".ml".
