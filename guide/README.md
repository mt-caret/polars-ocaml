# Polars user guide examples

The expect tests in this directory are examples in the [official Polars user
guide](https://pola-rs.github.io/polars-book/user-guide/) which have been ported
over to OCaml.

The examples should be reasonably complete as of 2023-08-04, but if you find any
examples which are missing here, please feel free to
[open an issue](https://github.com/mt-caret/polars-ocaml/issues)!
